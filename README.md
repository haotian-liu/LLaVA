### Pretraining Dataset
The pretraining dataset used in this release is a subset of CC-3M dataset, filtered with a more balanced concept coverage distribution.  Please see [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-CC3M-Pretrain-595K) for a detailed description on the dataset structure and how to download the images.

If you already have CC-3M dataset on your disk, the image names follow this format: `GCC_train_000000000.jpg`.  You may edit the `image` field correspondingly if necessary.

| Data | Chat File | Meta Data | Size |
| --- |  --- |  --- | ---: |
| CC-3M Concept-balanced 595K | [chat.json](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-CC3M-Pretrain-595K/raw/main/chat.json) | [metadata.json](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-CC3M-Pretrain-595K/raw/main/metadata.json) | 211 MB

**Important notice**: Upon the request from the community, as ~15% images of the original CC-3M dataset are no longer accessible, we upload [`images.zip`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-CC3M-Pretrain-595K/blob/main/images.zip) for better reproducing our work in research community. It must not be used for any other purposes. The use of these images must comply with the CC-3M license. This may be taken down at any time when requested by the original CC-3M dataset owner or owners of the referenced images.

### GPT-4 Prompts

We provide our prompts and few-shot samples for GPT-4 queries, to better facilitate research in this domain.  Please check out the [`prompts`](playground/data/prompts) folder for three kinds of questions: conversation, detail description, and complex reasoning.

They are organized in a format of `system_message.txt` for system message, pairs of `abc_caps.txt` for few-shot sample user input, and `abc_conv.txt` for few-shot sample reference output.

Note that you may find them in different format. For example, `conversation` is in `jsonl`, and detail description is answer-only.  The selected format in our preliminary experiments work slightly better than a limited set of alternatives that we tried: `jsonl`, more natural format, answer-only.  If interested, you may try other variants or conduct more careful study in this.  Contributions are welcomed!

## LLaVA Weights
We release [LLaVA](https://llava-vl.github.io/) weights as delta weights to comply with the LLaMA model license.
You can add our delta to the original LLaMA weights to obtain the LLaVA weights.

Instructions:

1. Get the original LLaMA weights in the huggingface format by following the instructions [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama).
2. Use the following scripts to get LLaVA weights by applying our delta ([13b-v0](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/LLaVA-13b-delta-v0), [7b-v0](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/LLaVA-7b-delta-v0), [lightning-7B-v1-1](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Lightning-7B-delta-v1-1)). It will automatically download delta weights from our Hugging Face account.

### LLaVA-13B
This conversion command needs around 60 GB of CPU RAM.
```bash
python3 -m llava.model.apply_delta \
    --base /path/to/llama-13b \
    --target /output/path/to/LLaVA-13B-v0 \
    --delta liuhaotian/LLaVA-13b-delta-v0
```

### LLaVA-7B
This conversion command needs around 30 GB of CPU RAM.
```bash
python3 -m llava.model.apply_delta \
    --base /path/to/llama-7b \
    --target /output/path/to/LLaVA-7B-v0 \
    --delta liuhaotian/LLaVA-7b-delta-v0
```


### LLaVA pretrained projector weights
The initial release is pretrained on [LLaVA-filtered CC3M 595K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-CC3M-Pretrain-595K) with 1 epoch.  The pretrained weights are released [here](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/LLaVA-13b-pretrain-projector-v0).

You may perform instruction tuning on our pretrained checkpoints, by using our [visual instruction tuning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Instruct-150K) data following the instructions [here](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA#fine-tuning-with-local-gpus).

## Serving

### Web UI

#### Launch a controller
```Shell
python -m llava.serve.controller --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000
```

#### Launch a model worker
```Shell
python -m llava.serve.model_worker --host 0.0.0.0 --controller http://localhost:10000 --port 40000 --worker http://localhost:40000 --model-path ./checkpoints/LLaVA-13B-v0 --multi-modal
```
Wait until the process finishes loading the model and you see "Uvicorn running on ...".

#### Launch a model worker (Multiple GPUs, when GPU VRAM <= 24GB)

If your the VRAM of your GPU is less than 24GB (e.g., RTX 3090, RTX 4090, etc.), you may try running it with multiple GPUs.

```Shell
python -m llava.serve.model_worker --host 0.0.0.0 --controller http://localhost:10000 --port 40000 --worker http://localhost:40000 --model-path ./checkpoints/LLaVA-13B-v0 --multi-modal --num-gpus 2
```
Wait until the process finishes loading the model and you see "Uvicorn running on ...".

#### Launch a gradio web server.
```Shell
python -m llava.serve.gradio_web_server --controller http://localhost:10000
```
#### You can open your browser and chat with a model now.

### CLI Inference

A starting script for inference with LLaVA without the need of Gradio interface. The current implementation only supports for a single-turn Q-A session, and the interactive CLI is WIP.  This also serves as an example for users to build customized inference scripts.

```Shell
python -m llava.eval.run_llava \
    --model-name /path/to/LLaVA-13B-v0 \
    --image-file "https://llava-vl.github.io/static/images/view.jpg" \
    --query "What are the things I should be cautious about when I visit here?"
```

Example output (varies in different runs):

> When visiting this picturesque location with a serene lake and a wooden pier extending over the water, one should be cautious about various safety aspects. Some important considerations include:
> 
> 1. Ensuring that the pier is structurally sound andstable, as old or weakened pier structures might not support the weight of visitors.
> 2. Being aware of the water depth around the pier and lake, as sudden drop-offs or strong currents may pose a risk to swimmers, boaters, or those who venture too close to the edge.
> 3. Staying vigilant about the presence of wildlife in the area, such as slippery, stealthy fish or other animals that might cause harm or inconvenience.
> 4. Maintaining a safe distance from the water's edge, particularly for children, elderly individuals, or those who are not strong swimmers.
> 5. Following any posted signs or guidelines related to safety and the use of the pier and surrounding areas.
> 
> By considering these safety precautions, visitors can enjoy the natural beauty of the location while minimizing risks and ensuring a safe and pleasant experience.


## Evaluation

### GPT-assisted Evaluation

Our GPT-assisted evaluation pipeline for multimodal modeling is provided for a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities of vision-language models.  Please see our paper for more details.

1. Generate LLaVA responses

```Shell
python model_vqa.py \
    --model-name ./checkpoints/LLaVA-13B-v0 \
    --question-file \
    playground/data/coco2014_val_qa_eval/qa90_questions.jsonl \
    --image-folder \
    /path/to/coco2014_val \
    --answers-file \
    /path/to/answer-file.jsonl
```

2. Evaluate the generated responses.  In our case, [`answer-file-1.jsonl`](./playground/data/coco2014_val_qa_eval/qa90_gpt4_answer.jsonl) is the response generated by text-only GPT-4 (0314), with the context captions/boxes provided.

```Shell
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-***********************************" python eval_gpt_review_visual.py \
    --question playground/data/coco2014_val_qa_eval/qa90_questions.jsonl \
    --context table/caps_boxes_coco2014_val_80.jsonl \
    --answer-list \
    /path/to/answer-file-1.jsonl \
    /path/to/answer-file-2.jsonl \
    --rule table/rule.json \
    --output /path/to/review.json
```

3. Summarize the evaluation results

```Shell
python summarize_gpt_review.py
```

### ScienceQA

#### Prepare Data
1. Please see ScienceQA [repo](https://github.com/lupantech/ScienceQA) for setting up the dataset.
2. Generate ScienceQA dataset for LLaVA conversation-style format.

```Shell
python scripts/convert_sqa_to_llava \
    convert_to_llava \
    --base-dir /path/to/ScienceQA/data/scienceqa \
    --split {train,val,minival,test,minitest}
```

#### Evaluation

1. Download our pretrained LLaVA-13B (delta) weights for ScienceQA dataset [here](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/LLaVA-13b-delta-v0-science_qa).  Convert the delta weights to actual weights.

```Shell
python -m llava.model.apply_delta \
    --base /path/to/llama-13b \
    --target /path/to/LLaVA-13b-v0-science_qa \
    --delta liuhaotian/LLaVA-13b-delta-v0-science_qa
```

2. [Option 1] Multiple-GPU inference
You may evaluate this with multiple GPUs, and concatenate the generated jsonl files.  Please refer to our script for [batch evaluation](scripts/sqa_eval_batch.sh) and [results gathering](scripts/sqa_eval_gather.sh).

3. [Option 2] Single-GPU inference

(a) Generate LLaVA responses on ScienceQA dataset

```Shell
python -m llava.eval.model_vqa_science \
    --model-name /path/to/LLaVA-13b-v0-science_qa \
    --question-file /path/to/ScienceQA/data/scienceqa/llava_test.json \
    --image-folder /path/to/ScienceQA/data/scienceqa/images/test \
    --answers-file vqa/results/ScienceQA/test_llava-13b.jsonl \
    --answer-prompter
    --conv-mode simple
```

(b) Evaluate the generated responses

```Shell
python eval_science_qa.py \
    --base-dir /path/to/ScienceQA/data/scienceqa \
    --result-file vqa/results/ScienceQA/test_llava-13b.jsonl \
    --output-file vqa/results/ScienceQA/test_llava-13b_output.json \
    --output-result vqa/results/ScienceQA/test_llava-13b_result.json \
```

For reference, we attach our prediction file `test_llava-13b_result.json` [here](llava/eval/table/results/test_sqa_llava_13b_v0.json) for comparison when reproducing our results, as well as for further analysis in detail.

## Fine-tuning
### Data

The current version of LLaVA is fine-tuned from a Vicuna-13B model.  We use approximately 600K filtered CC3M in feature alignment pretraining and 150K GPT-generated multimodal instruction-following data in finetuning. For detailed description of the data generation pipeline, please refer see our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08485).

We are working on a more capable model that is pretrained with the data at a larger scale.  Stay tuned!

We release all three types of multimodal instruction-following data.  The use of these data is subject to OpenAI [TOS](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use).

### Code and Hyperparameters
We fine-tune the model using the code from [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat). We use a similar set of hyperparameters as Vicuna in finetuning.  Both hyperparameters used in pretraining and finetuning are provided below.

1. Pretraining

| Hyperparameter | Global Batch Size | Learning rate | Epochs | Max length | Weight decay |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| LLaVA-13B | 128 | 2e-3 | 1 | 2048 | 0 |

2. Finetuning

| Hyperparameter | Global Batch Size | Learning rate | Epochs | Max length | Weight decay |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| LLaVA-13B | 32 | 2e-5 | 3 | 2048 | 0 |

### Fine-tuning with Local GPUs
LLaVA is trained on 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB memory with the following code. To train on fewer GPUs, you can reduce the `per_device_train_batch_size` and increase the `gradient_accumulation_steps` accordingly to keep the global batch size the same.

1. Pretraining

#### LLaVA-MPT-7b
Thanks to LLaVA-Lightning, we are able to train a checkpoint based on MPT-7b-Chat on 8x A100 GPUs in just 3 hours, including both pretraining and finetuning.

**NOTE**: This is a research preview of the LLaVA-Lightning based on MPT-7B-chat checkpoint. The usage of the model should comply with MPT-7B-chat license and agreements.

**NOTE**: Unlike other LLaVA models, this model should be used directly without delta weights conversion!

**NOTE**: You need to upgrade to our latest code base to use LLaVA-MPT-7b!

1. Usage

You do not need to download our checkpoint, it will directly load from our Hugging Face model: [`liuhaotian/LLaVA-Lightning-MPT-7B-preview`](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Lightning-MPT-7B-preview).

```Shell
python -m llava.serve.controller --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000
python -m llava.serve.model_worker --host 0.0.0.0 --controller http://localhost:10000 --port 40000 --worker http://localhost:40000 --model-path liuhaotian/LLaVA-Lightning-MPT-7B-preview
python -m llava.serve.gradio_web_server --controller http://localhost:10000
```

2. Training

We use the same set of training dataset, and the hyperparameters as other Lightning checkpoints.

```Shell
bash ./scripts/train_lightning_mpt.sh

**NOTE**: Due to that ScienceQA experiments were done earlier, the current checkpoints are trained *without* `<im_start>` and `<im_end>` tokens.  Checkpoints with these tokens will be updated later.  Here we provide our training scripts for the current checkpoints.
